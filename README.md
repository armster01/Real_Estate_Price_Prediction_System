# Real Estate Price Prediction System
## Overview
This project predicts real estate prices using machine learning. It leverages an XGBoost Regressor model to analyze and estimate property prices based on various features, such as location, size, and amenities. The goal is to provide a reliable tool for predicting real estate prices, supporting decisions in the real estate sector.

## Project Features
1.Data Processing: Cleans and preprocesses real estate data to prepare for analysis.
2.Feature Engineering: Adds new features and refines existing ones to improve model accuracy.
3.Model Training: Trains an XGBoost Regressor model on historical real estate data.
4.Model Evaluation: Evaluates the model's accuracy using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
5.Prediction: Offers a simple interface to input property data and receive price predictions.

# Model
The model used in this project is the XGBoost Regressor, a powerful and efficient gradient-boosting algorithm, which is well-suited for structured/tabular data.

## Key Model Parameters:
learning_rate: Controls the learning rate of the model
n_estimators: Number of trees in the model
max_depth: Maximum depth of each tree
Tweak these parameters as necessary for your model.

# Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated based on:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
The results indicate the model's effectiveness in accurately predicting property prices.

## Results
Provide a summary of your model's accuracy and error metrics.

## Future Enhancements
Improve feature engineering for increased prediction accuracy.
Experiment with hyperparameter tuning for optimal model performance.
Integrate a web interface for user-friendly property price prediction.
